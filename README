Image Tools

Blender has builtin function about image edition,
but for now nothing shows up in the ui about resizing, cropping,
rotating, mirroring etc.. this should eventually be integrated one day.

meanwhile, this tool integrates the features of nconvert in the image editor
panel. but watch out about nconvert licence : free for open source or home
project, contact the author at http://www.xnview.com/en/nconvert.html else.

you need to download nconvert for your os and drop the nconvert folder or
the nconvert exe into the image tools folder.

tested on windows XP and ubuntu 11.10 so far.

readme wip..
meanwhile (doc, screencaps, video) :
